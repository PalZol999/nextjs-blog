Have you ever wondered why all success stories are often shared only after the individuals have achieved success? 
You've probably come across stories like, "I became a Web Developer in just 6 months and now I have a six-figure job at Goog-book-flix," which are quite popular on the internet.


  <br>
While those stories are great to hear, let's take a step back and consider the journey from the very beginning.
It all started last year in July 2022 when my career as a CrossFit coach wasn't financially fulfilling anymore, and I had to explore other opportunities. My initial plan was to become a part-time manual tester, given its ease of learning and flexibility. However, as I delved deeper into the world of technology, I found myself drawn into the fascinating downward spiral of coding. It has become a lifestyle for me now.

 <br>
Previously, I used to listen to metal music while driving, but now, I'm engrossed in understanding web development podcasts, sometimes even stopping on the side of the road to take notes.
My YouTube page used to be filled with CrossFit and Norwegian black metal band videos, but now it's all about Indian individuals explaining data structures, FireShip, and ThePrimeTime enlightening the tech world.
I made a resolution to practice coding every single day without any days off until I achieve my goals. ChatGPT has become my mentor, and Udemy serves as my online school.

<br>
Now, let's dive into the four reasons why I decided to start this blog:

 <br>
 <p>
<b>Reason One:</b>  As I was practicing NextJs by creating a Blog site, I realized that I could share my thoughts and struggles through this blog. Even if nobody reads it, I can use it as a journal to document my journey as a developer.
 </p>

 <br>
  <p>
<b>Reason Two:</b> English Practice As a French person living in Hungary, this blog provides an awsome platform for me to practice and improve my English skills. </p>

 <br>
  <p>
<b>Reason Three:</b> Maintaining and Improving NextJS Skills With each new blog post, I update my blog site, which helps me keep my NextJS repository alive. It's all about consistent practice, and I probably should have started with that from the beginning! </p>

 <br>
  <p>
<b>Reason Four:</b> Inspiring Others Although it might seem unlikely, one of the reasons for this blog is to potentially inspire others who may be on a similar journey or considering a career change.
 </p>

 <br>
So, here we are, with the first content and first upload. I hope to create many more posts in the future. Until then, I'll continue practicing, learning, staying informed, and keeping track of the ever-evolving tech world.
