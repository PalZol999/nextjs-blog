  At the start of the incredible journey to become a web developer, we all have various "existential" questions like: "Will I ever become skilled enough?" "Will I find a place in this industry?" "Is my knowledge sufficient to start looking for a job?" and so on... but one of the most challenging questions (once we've grasped the HTML/CSS/JavaScript trio) is: "What should I learn first: React, Vue, or Angular?"

 <br>

Oh, those three little piggies! If you choose one, you might feel like you're building your house with straw. When I began learning Angular, all the frontend job opportunities were about Vue. <br>
On the other hand, all of my industry friends and the knowledgeable folks on the internet suggest starting with React because "everyone's using React," they say. <br>
Sure, but they have forget to tell the companies looking for developers that "everyone's using React"? Because they seem to prefer the other two options. <br>
Anyway, I decided to start with this one, and I'll stick with it until I master it. (even if sometimes NextJS comes to my aid)

There is a common idea that gives me some comfort â€“ if you know one library/framework, you can "easily" switch to another one. To be honest, at this point in my career, I can't really form a strong opinion on that matter. <br>
I mentioned that I've already used NextJS (for example, this Blog site has been built with Next), but that's about it. <br>
I don't know how much effort it would take to switch to Vue, Svelte, Angular, or any other. That's why sometimes I try to go back to my basics (yes, JS, I'm talking about you). I want to avoid becoming a "framework" programmer and strive to be more like a "programmer." Maybe that will make a difference.(Wink-wink HR boys and girls!)

</div>
 <br>

So far, we've covered HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and we need to complement CSS with Tailwind and/or Bootstrap, and choose between React, Angular, or Vue.<br>
After making my final choice, I try to catch up with what I don't know and keep up with the things that few people know.<br>
Firstly, it's about understanding design patterns and the concepts behind any programming language. It's about adopting the mentality of a web developer and speaking the "React language" (or any other chosen framework).
Secondly, it's about keeping up with the latest trends and developments. <br> 
I've been fortunate enough to follow the new SSR implementation of ReactJS from the beginning. I've listened to conferences and several podcasts on this subject. And you know what? Even tech experts with over 10 years of experience struggle to fully understand this new approach. <br> 
And this isn't me complaining about how difficult it is to keep up with these innovations, but rather it's about how amazing the tech world is. <br> <br>
In the field of web development, you simply can't stick to a one-track mind. Innovation and fundamentals are essential because the technology of yesterday may change tomorrow.<br> <br>
